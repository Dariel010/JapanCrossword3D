      <br><br> Each of the numbers on the left side indicates how many cells are
      shaded in groups in the corresponding row. Between the groups there must be
      at least one cell that is not shaded. In the same way, the numbers at the top
      show the vertical groups. To solve a puzzle, it's usually most helpful to start
      with the biggest groups. Take a look at the numbers above and to the left and
      find the largest of them. <br><br><br><br><br> <margin-left=46%><align="center"><sprite
      index=7><align="center"></margin><br><br><br><br><br> <br> <align="left">The
      last line of the left column with the numbers is the number 5 (red). It indicates
      that this line has 5 consecutive shaded cells. Since the entire grid has a
      width of 5 cells in all, it follows that they should all be painted over. In
      the first line, we see the number 3. This might be across columns 1-2-3, 2-3-4,
      or 3-4-5. But wherever this block of three cells is located, the central cell
      in column 3 will be colored for certain. If there was a group of 4, we could
      safely paint the 2nd, 3rd and 4th cells of its row. <br><br><br><br><br> <margin-left=46%><align="center"><sprite
      index=8><align="center"></margin> <br><br><br><br><br><br> <align="left">Now
      we look at the numbers above. The first column is 1. It indicates that only
      one cell of this column is painted. Since we already have such a cell, we can
      tell that the rest will certainly not be painted, so we can safely put dot
      markers in those cells. Above columns 2, 3, 4, and 5 there are two numbers,
      therefore in each of these columns there will be two groups of filled cells.
      The bottom numbers in three of those columns are 1, and we already have one
      shaded cell at the bottom of each column, so we can put dot markers on top
      of the shaded cells to let us know there will not be another painted cell there.
      <br><br><br><br><br> <margin-left=46%><align="center"><sprite index=9><align="center"></margin>
      <br><br><br><br><br><br> <align="left">In the second column the bottom number
      is 3, hence the lower group consists of three cells. We already have one cell
      painted, and it's against the bottom edge, so we can add two cells above and
      put a dot marker on top. In the third column, where we already have one cell
      painted at the top, the upper number is 3. In this column, we can paint 2 more
      cells below the one already painted, so that the top 3 are covered. <br><br><br><br><br>
      <margin-left=46%><align="center"><sprite index=10><align="center"></margin>
      <br><br><br><br><br><br><align="left">In the third row, we formed a group of
      two cells. The first figure, 2, shows that we have fully painted this block,
      so we put a marker to the right of this group. In this same row, there is still
      a number 1 left to fill, and only one cell empty and unmarked, so we can paint
      it over. In the first row, which has only a number 3, we've already identified
      the first cell is empty. With only 4 cells left available, we can paint another
      cell in the middle. This is confirmed by the top number 1 in the fourth vertical
      column. <br><br><br><br><br> <margin-left=46%><align="center"><sprite index=11><align="center"></margin>
      <br><br><br><br><br><br><align="left">There are very few cells left open now.
      Number 2 in the fifth vertical column shows that we need to add another shaded
      cell in this column. This block is now complete, so we put a marker on top.
      We've still got one open cell in the first row. Since we need 3 in this first
      horizontal row, it is necessary to paint it. <br><br><br><br><br> <margin-left=46%><align="center"><sprite
